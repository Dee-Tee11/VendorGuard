# Changes

Summary of what exists as of 2026-10-19. The repo has no commits yet, so this is a snapshot of the working tree, not a per-commit log.

## Done

**Service** ([app/main.py](app/main.py))
- FastAPI app with a lifespan hook that creates the `webhook_events` table on startup.
- `GET /healthz` for Render's health check.
- `POST /webhooks/paypal`: parses the body, verifies the signature, stores the event, and returns `stored` or `duplicate`. Invalid JSON and bad signatures return 400.
- Blocking work (PayPal call, DB write) runs in the threadpool so it does not stall the event loop.

**PayPal verification** ([app/paypal.py](app/paypal.py))
- Cheap pre-check: all five `PAYPAL-*` signature headers must be present and `PAYPAL-CERT-URL` must match a `paypal.com` API host. Failures return 400 without calling PayPal.
- Signature check through PayPal's `verify-webhook-signature` endpoint.
- OAuth client-credentials token, cached in memory until 60 s before expiry.
- Network errors and PayPal 5xx raise, so PayPal retries the delivery.

**Storage** ([app/db.py](app/db.py))
- `webhook_events` table (`id`, `event_type`, `body jsonb`, `received_at`).
- `claim_event()` inserts with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and reports whether the event was new, which makes redelivery safe.

**Tests** ([tests/](tests/)): 5 passing as of today.
- U11: failed signature returns 400 and stores nothing.
- U12: the same event sent twice is stored once.
- S07 (3 cases): missing headers, a foreign cert URL, and a missing signature header are rejected before PayPal is called.

**Project setup**
- [render.yaml](render.yaml): Render blueprint with a web service and a free Postgres.
- `requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `pytest.ini`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`.

## Not done yet

- Authentication and authorization (in progress).
- Anything that reads or acts on `webhook_events`. Events are stored and nothing else happens.
- Open review points: see [RECHECK.md](RECHECK.md).
